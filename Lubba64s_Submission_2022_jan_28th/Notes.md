### PRE ANALYSIS:
I chose to do this in python because it is a language I use a lot for quick scripting,  
its also the language I originally did this challenge with.  
  
I never finished the original challenge as I ran out of time fixing some things.  
I also don't have the source for the original submission because I lost it :/  
  
I will finish this one in under an hour.  
  
### POST ANALYSIS

I recorded the attempt, and completed the challenge in 49 minutes, 44 seconds

honestly the code itself is hot garbage but I really did just do it as quickly as possible.

this was a fun little experiment and I am glad I did it as I definetly did this way better than I did it last time.
